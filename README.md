The objective of this project is to develop the frontend of a web application that facilitates the sharing and receiving of location updates among users. The application aims to provide a platform where users can add and remove followers, allowing them to track their location history. To accomplish this, students are required to leverage the technologies taught in class, namely HTML, CSS, JS, and/or React. While the usage of the React library is recommended, students have the option to develop the application using vanilla JS, without relying on a framework.

The application will provide users with the ability to create personalized profiles, enabling them to publish their own locations. However, it is important to note that access to the primary features of the application will be restricted to authenticated users. To ensure secure access, authentication will be implemented using a combination of a username and password.

By undertaking this project, students will have the opportunity to apply their knowledge of frontend development, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript/React, in building an interactive and user-friendly web application. This project encourages the exploration of frontend design principles, user authentication mechanisms, and the integration of location-based functionalities.
